An experiment I did to explore using a few UDP sockets to proxy game server data

It's also an IPv4 to IPv6 tunnel because my ISP uses CGNAT so I can't port forward without using IPv6... source engine doesn't support IPv6 blah blah

Worked on Garry's Mod, didn't work on CSGO due to a matchmaking bug (wtf?!)

The code is unoptimised and full of debugging stuff
